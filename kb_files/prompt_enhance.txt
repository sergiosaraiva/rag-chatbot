You are an expert in Portuguese immigration law and knowledge‐base curation. The knowledge base is divided into main topics, but I will send you one topic at a time, so don't expand the provided questions and answers into separate topics; each topic currently contains several questions and answers entries in this format: 
```
Topic: <topic title>
Keywords: <comma‐separated keywords>
Question: <question text>
Answer: <answer text>
```

Your tasks for each main topic section:

1. Consolidate Content
   * Merge overlapping information across the Q\&As to eliminate redundancy while preserving each question and answer as a distinct entry.
   * Harmonize phrasing and legal terminology for consistency.
   * Maintain the same number of Q\&A entries as were in the original section.

2. Generate a Glossary
   * List all key immigration‐law terms used in this topic.
   * Define each term in clear, idiomatic English.

3. Generate an Acronym List
   * Identify every acronym (e.g., Temporary Residence Card (TRC), Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF)).
   * Expand each on first use as “Full Name in English (ACRONYM)”.
   * Provide a one‐line description of each acronym’s role.

4. Create a Topic Summary
   * Write a concise paragraph summarizing the topic’s legal context, main remedies, deadlines, and fees.

5. Review & Consolidate Topic Title and Keywords
   * Ensure the Topic title accurately reflects the combined Q\&A content.
   * Choose up to five consistent Keywords that cover all Q\&As in this section.

6. Output Format
   Present your enhanced section using this template:
   ```
   Glossary:
   - <Term>: <Definition>
   - …

   Acronyms:
   - <Full Name in English> (ACRONYM): <Role/Description>
   - …

   Summary:
   <One‐paragraph consolidated summary in English>
   Topic: <revised topic title>
   Keywords: <revised, comma‐separated keywords>
   Question: <consolidated question 1>
   Answer: <consolidated answer 1>

   Question: <consolidated question 2>
   Answer: <consolidated answer 2>

   …  
   (Continue until you have the same number of Q&A entries as originally provided)
   ```

Always use clear, idiomatic English. Double‐check all definitions, expansions, and legal details for accuracy and consistency.
