Summary: Naturalization is the principal pathway for foreign nationals to obtain Portuguese citizenship under Law no. 37/81 (as amended), requiring applicants to prove continuous legal residence in Portugal for at least five years anchorless, demonstrate basic Portuguese language ability at CEFR A2 level, maintain a clean criminal record with no convictions punishable by three or more years’ imprisonment, and show socio-economic integration through employment, education, or community ties. Applicants submit their dossier—including passport or ID, residence permit, criminal record certificates from Portugal and the country of origin, language certificate, proof of accommodation and means of subsistence—to the Institute of Registries and Notaries (IRN) or a local Civil Registry office and pay a €250 application fee. Decisions are typically rendered within 12–24 months, after which successful candidates take an oath of allegiance and receive their Citizen Card.
