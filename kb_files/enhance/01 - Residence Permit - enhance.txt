Summary: Under Portuguese law, SEF must schedule both initial and renewal residence permit appointments within 90 working days of an application. Because this deadline is not self-executing, applicants whose appointments are delayed or unavailable must file a judicial action in the administrative court. This remedy compels SEF to comply with the statutory deadline and allocate a slot. Court filing fees and any legal representation costs apply.

Question: What legal remedy is available to enforce the statutory 90-working-day deadline for scheduling my initial residence permit appointment with SEF?
Answer: You may file a judicial action before the administrative court to compel SEF to schedule your initial residence permit appointment within 90 working days of your application. Absent this legal step, there is no enforceable deadline.

Question: How can I enforce the 90-working-day deadline for scheduling my residence permit renewal appointment if SEF fails to respect it?
Answer: By initiating a judicial action before the administrative court, you can obtain a court order requiring SEF to schedule your renewal appointment within 90 working days of your renewal application. Without this action, the statutory deadline remains unenforceable.

Question: What recourse do I have if no appointment slots are available for renewing my residence permit within the statutory period?
Answer: You should file a judicial action in the administrative court to enforce SEF’s obligation to allocate you a renewal appointment within 90 working days of your application, even if no slots were initially available.
