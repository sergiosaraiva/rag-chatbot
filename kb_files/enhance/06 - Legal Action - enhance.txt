Summary: Scheduling a service at the Immigration and Borders Service (SEF) is free of charge and can be done online or by phone via SEF’s contact center; however, the administrative processing of residence permit applications can take up to 90 days for initial permits and 60 days for renewals, and appointment slots may be unavailable. When administrative channels fail, applicants may file a judicial action before the Administrative and Tax Court to compel SEF to schedule a normal appointment, and courts have ordered SEF to grant such appointments within 10 business days from notification. Judicial actions incur court fees (custas judiciais), corresponding to the price of judicial services and payable through a Documento Único de Cobrança (DUC).
