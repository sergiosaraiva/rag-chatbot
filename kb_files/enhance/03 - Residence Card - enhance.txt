Summary: This section describes how non-EU nationals may obtain or enforce issuance of a Temporary Residence Card (TRC) in Portugal—either by filing a judicial enforcement action against SEF to compel issuance and scheduling of collection within the statutory 90-working-day deadline or by regularizing status under the student regime. The general legal-action route takes approximately two to three months, with fees ranging from €500 to €800 depending on the stage and remedy, and requires supporting documents such as a signed power of attorney, passport copy, proof of TRC application or expired permit, and a court-signed declaration via the SIS. Applicants must also provide specific identification numbers (NIF, NISS) and, where applicable, proof of social security contributions or an Expression of Interest. Alternatively, those without prior status may enroll in a recognized Portuguese educational institution and submit a SEF application for a student residence permit.

Question: What is the timeline, cost, and required documentation for obtaining a Temporary Residence Card (TRC) through judicial action?
Answer: The judicial action process typically takes 2–3 months from filing to card receipt. You must file an enforcement petition with the Administrative Court and request a court-signed declaration via the Schengen Information System (SIS) to notify your country of origin. Fees total €800, payable in two installments (€400 on filing and €400 on card issuance). Required documents include:
* A signed power of attorney
* A copy of your valid passport
* Proof of a prior TRC application or an expired permit
* The court-signed declaration obtained via SIS

Question: What legal remedy can I pursue if I completed biometric registration but have not received my residence card or any notification?
Answer: You may file a judicial enforcement action before the Administrative Court to compel the Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF) to schedule your TRC collection appointment within the statutory 90-working-day deadline from the date of biometric registration. Without this action, there is no enforceable administrative deadline.

Question: What can I do if I have completed my biometric registration but still have not received my residence card?
Answer: You may initiate a judicial enforcement action in the Administrative Court to enforce the 90-working-day deadline for issuing and scheduling collection of your card. This requires submitting proof of biometric registration and payer of the applicable court fees.

Question: I submitted my criminal record certificate on \[DATE] following biometric notification but have not received my residence card; what legal remedy is available?
Answer: File a judicial enforcement action against SEF to enforce the 90-working-day deadline measured from the date you submitted all required documents—including your criminal record certificate—to compel issuance and collection scheduling of your TRC.

Question: How can I regularize my status in Portugal if I live there without any immigration documents?
Answer: Enroll in a recognized Portuguese educational institution and apply to SEF for a student residence permit. Upon acceptance, submit your application through SEF with proof of enrollment and supporting documentation to obtain a TRC under the student regime.

Question: What legal action can I take if I have completed biometric registration but have not received my Temporary Residence Card (TRC)?
Answer: You can file a judicial enforcement action before the Administrative Court to compel SEF to issue and make available for collection your TRC within 90 working days of biometric registration.
