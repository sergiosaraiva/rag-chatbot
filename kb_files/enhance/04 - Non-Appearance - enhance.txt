Summary: When an applicant misses a scheduled appointment with the Agency for Integration, Migration and Asylum, AIMA issues a “Non-Appearance Notification (Falta).” To avoid cancellation of the underlying procedure, the applicant should promptly forward this notification to their legal representative. The representative will then access the AIMA Portal to request a rescheduling of the missed appointment. There is typically no fee for this first rescheduling, but it must be done within any deadline specified on the notification to preserve the application’s validity.
