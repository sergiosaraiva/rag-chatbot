Summary: Under Portuguese immigration law, applicants who have submitted a Criminal Record Certificate (Police Clearance Certificate, PCC) but have not received their residence permit within 90 working days may file a non-appearance or delay notification with the Agency for Integration, Migration and Asylum (AIMA). This triggers an expedited judicial review to enforce the statutory deadline. Applicants must pay a total judicial fee of €500 (split into a €300 advance and €200 upon completion) and submit supporting documentation—including identification numbers (NIF, NISS, SNS), legal status proof, employment evidence or an Expression of Interest (EOI), recent payslips, proof of residence, job contract or self-employment documents, and the PCC itself—to secure issuance of their residence card.
