# RAG Chatbot Knowledge Base

## Introduction to RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods for building AI systems. In a RAG system, a retrieval component first fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, and then a generative model uses these retrieved pieces to produce an informed response.

RAG offers several advantages:

1. **Up-to-date information**: The knowledge base can be updated independently of the model, allowing the system to access current information.
2. **Reduced hallucinations**: By grounding the generation in retrieved facts, the model is less likely to produce factually incorrect information.
3. **Transparency**: The system can cite its sources, making the response more verifiable and trustworthy.

## ChromaDB

ChromaDB is an open-source embedding database designed for AI applications. It provides efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings, making it ideal for semantic search operations in RAG systems.

Key features of ChromaDB include:

- Efficient similarity search for embeddings
- Support for metadata filtering
- Multiple persistence options
- Easy integration with popular embedding models

## Docker Containerization

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications into containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone executable packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

Benefits of containerization include:

- **Consistency**: Applications run the same regardless of where they're deployed
- **Isolation**: Applications and their dependencies are isolated from the host system
- **Portability**: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker
- **Scalability**: Containers can be easily scaled up or down
- **Version Control**: Container images can be versioned, allowing for easy rollbacks

## Railway Cloud Deployment

Railway is a modern cloud development platform that makes deploying applications simple. It offers a streamlined workflow for developers, handling much of the infrastructure complexity automatically.

Railway features for deployment:

- **Git Integration**: Deploy directly from GitHub repositories
- **Environment Variables**: Securely manage configuration
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically scale resources based on demand
- **Monitoring**: Built-in monitoring and logging
- **Easy Rollbacks**: Quickly revert to previous deployments if issues arise
